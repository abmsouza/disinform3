           <h3>Disinformation and Media Literacy</h3>
            <p class="headings">1. Overview</p><br>
            <p>We live in a moment with increasingly challenging media challenges. The concept of "fake news" and "post-truth" became part of everyday life for the last few years, and it affects our society in various levels, and even our security, mainly politically and socially. Within such an environment, discussions about media literacy become more necessary in an attempt to offer a compass to navigate the flood of information safely. Those discussions are even more present in the educational sector, with teachers facing the challenge to bring this topic to the class and to raise their students' awareness concerning information and media, especially in the realm of the internet and social media. Groups of research have been formed to evaluate, discuss, and generate knowledge and strategies towards a higher level of internet/media literacy,  such as the <a href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:fv751yt5934/SHEG%20Evaluating%20Information%20Online.pdf" target="_blank">Stanford History Education Group's study</a>, or the <a href="http://getbadnews.com/#intro"><i>Bad News game</i></a>, from Cambridge University. For this essay, some of those initiatives were studied to provide a basis for the development of the final part of this class, the web site.</p><br>
              
            <p class="headings">2. Disinformation: concept</p><br>
            <p>First, there's a need to define precisely the problem of "fake news". Following the studies consulted, we will replace this term for a more specific term: our goal will be to discuss <i>disinformation</i>. For that, we will start by establishing its difference from <i>misinformation</i>, which is also often associated with "fake news". </p>
            <p><i>Disinformation</i>, according to the Oxford Dictionary of Media and Communication, is "the dissemination of false information with the deliberate intent to deceive or mislead." while <i>misinformation</i> is "the dissemination of false information, either knowingly or unknowingly." Misinformation, therefore, is understood as an unintentional spread of false information.  While it is in itself a problem, the leading concern is disinformation, for the critical challenge it poses. Disinformation is a deliberate, weaponized, use of media in general - and the internet more significantly. This use of media and the internet menaces even to threaten societal security and is strategically perpetrated to serve any number of interests (mainly political). According to NATO's study <a href="https://www.stratcomcoe.org/digital-hydra-security-implications-false-information-online" target="_blank"><i>Digital Hydra</i></a>, the term disinformation  </p>
            <p class="quote">"is modelled after ‘dezinformatsiya’, a Russian term first coined by the KGB to refer to the use of false or otherwise misleading information that is purposely provided to selected audiences to influence their behaviour. This was part of the broader set of tactics called ‘active measures’, which frequently involved ‘attempts to deceive the target (foreign governmental and non-governmental elites or mass audiences), and to distort the target’s perception of reality’."</p>
            <p>The study also reminds us that the characteristic of disinformation in our age is not as focused on quality, as the old Soviet strategy. Today, this strategy counts with the flood of information characteristic of our times,  and therefore it is more focused on quantity. For that reason, unveiling the falsehoods for each story is not a very effective technique to deal with the problem, as another one will soon appear and confuse the public. A better approach to this is raising awareness of the public, and making this post-truth reality we face today a well-known one.</p><br>
            <p class="headings">3. Disinformation: problem</p><br>
            <p>Why is it a problem? As mentioned above, it poses a threat to societal security, and that is reached mainly by attempting to influence public opinion. How it works is that, by using different channels, but significantly social media, they disseminate distorted information, designed according to a particular interest, to reach a part of the public. This public often hooked and fails to recognize the manipulation present in the messages or posts that often come from friends or family, thus the goal of the disinformation campaign is then reached. As an example given by the <i>Bad News</i> info sheet for educators, around 15% of Twitter accounts are bots (software that autonomously performs actions impersonating users of the social media platform) and are hired in campaigns to bring specific political results. As an example, they remind us of the MacronLeaks during the French election in 2017, where Emmanuel Macron's campaign emails were leaked, distorted and manipulated, to create confusion and misinformation, two days before the election, in an attempt to influence the population's vote.</p><br>
             <p class="headings">4. Disinformation: defence</p><br>
            <p>There are some lines of defence against disinformation. Some of them are attempts from within  the main providers of social media platforms to improve their algorithms to "filter" misleading content, for an example. Another example would be better fact-checking tools, if possible in real-time, but that's not an easy task. Public regulations and specific laws are another step ahead in protecting ourselves. Finally, we also have <i>education</i>, which is our main focus for this work.
            </p>
            <p>Stanford History Education Group formed a team to study internet and media literacy, which they call <i>Civic Online Reasoning</i>. They attempted to measure students' performance on identifying the credibility of the information received online, from Middle School to College. The group was dismayed by the results from this research: in their own words, <p class="quote">"Overall, young people’s ability to reason about the information on the Internet can be summed up in one word: bleak."</p> <p>As a result of their study, they indicate that raising awareness towards this subject in class is fundamental to protect ourselves from becoming easy targets. As well, other studies such as NATO's <i>Digital Hydra</i> agree that this is an important step in the direction of our defence.</p>
            <p>Cambridge University researchers in collaboration with a Dutch group called DROG created a  game called <i>Bad News</i>, in which the player becomes the agent of spreading disinformation. The <i>Bad News</i> game turned into a major source of interest and inspiration for this project. Their authors work from a perspective of inoculation theory, which in their own words, "states that people can build up a resistance against false or misleading information by being presented with a weakened version of a misleading argument before being exposed to the “real” information". They intend that the game will work like a vaccine, where people can be presented to some of the main concepts behind disinformation: <i>impersonation; emotion; polarization; conspiracy; discredit;</i> and <i>trolling</i>.</p>
             
            <p>Facing the challenges brought by the post-truth world, being able to resist manipulation and to develop civic online reasoning, also means being aware of the disinformation strategy, and maintaining a critical posture regarding the information we receive. As is stated in the preamble to the constitution of UNESCO, (as quoted in <i>Digital Hydra,</i>)</p> <p class="quote"><i>"Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed".</i></p>
